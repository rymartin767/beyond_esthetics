            <p>
                The practice of medicine and aesthetics is not an exact science, and medical spa treatments are under the practice of medicine. Although great results are anticipated, there can be no guarantee or warranty, expressed or implied, by anyone as to the actual results you may get. Occasionally additional treatments and/or treatment for problems or complications may be required. These could result in additional charges for which you may be responsible.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond Esthetics is committed to serving you in the best way that we can. We will be honest in all our dealings with you. Aesthetics is not an exact science and how you may respond to a given treatment will vary from person to person. It is virtually impossible to predict results and therefore payments made for services are for treatments to be performed, not for a specific result. However, we will always strive to achieve the absolute best result that we can for you.
