Eric is a Scottsdale native, while Victoria grew up in the Bay Area. The two met in Coronado, California while Eric served in the Navy. Once Eric finished his service, the two moved back to Scottsdale where they started their family together. They have two daughters whom they hope to be role models for, especially in the health-and-wellness department, and they believe Fusion IV is a great steppingstone for achieving that. The Fitch’s enjoy spending time outside, going to the lake, and enjoying quality time with friends and family.</div>
