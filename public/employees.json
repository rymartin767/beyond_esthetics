        "bio": "<p>After graduating from Ohio State University’s undergraduate premedical program, my road to medicine began in 1992 when I entered the Ohio State University College of Medicine. Immediately interested in doing procedural based care, I begin my general surgical residency in 1996 at the Summa Health/Akron City Hospital. Finishing in 2001 and becoming board-certified in surgery, I then began my general surgical career which included not only general surgery but also trauma surgery and critical care in the cities of Lima, Ohio and then Mansfield, Ohio.</p><p><br></p><p>In 2013, I decided that trauma surgery was not amendable to my goals for a family and therefore relocated to New Albany, Ohio to practice general surgery only at Licking County Memorial Hospital where I currently practice today. When I am not in the operating room, I enjoy spending time with my wife Tiffany and son Andrew. I especially enjoy international travel but also equally enjoy life’s simple activities such as watching movies on big screen TV or even playing video games with my teenager.</p><p><br></p><p>So why would a general surgeon do cosmetics? Patients are my #1 priority. I take a great deal of pride in the care of my patients whether it be a complicated surgical issue or a simple cosmetic procedure. I have always had an interest in doing minor cosmetic procedures that patients desire to improve their overall appearance.</p><p><br></p><p>Over the years I have become more involved in doing predominantly injectables such as Botox for that purpose. However, the spectrum of cosmetic procedures has exploded in the last few years with all the improved equipment technology available for us. As a result of my interest in pursuing these, I have accepted the position as medical director for Beyond Esthetics and look forward to taking cosmetic enhancement to the next level.</p><p><br></p>",
